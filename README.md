# CheeseTouchBot.js
Author: Kayla Marcantonio

## Description
Server members try to infect others with the cheese touch (role) by setting a secret codeword with CheeseTouch bot.
Only one person gets the cheese touch at a time. Codewords cannot be reused. Each time you set a codeword it is added to the blacklist.
Know a friend that says "bet" too much? Set it as a codeword and infect them. First person to say the codeword gets infected!
